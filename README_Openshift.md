How to deploy to openshift
==========================

## Todo
- [ ] test running Docker image on plain Docker
- [ ] test running images from docker-compose
- [ ] test running image on openshift/minishift (expected to fail because of 'running as root' issue)
- [ ] build image based on modified Dockerfile
- [ ] test running image built from own Dockerfile on plain Docker
- [ ] test running image built from own Dockerfile from docker-compose
- [ ] test running image built from own Dockerfile on Openshift (expected to fail because of non-root issue)
- [ ] modify Dockerfile to run as non-root user (original tests shall still pass)
- [ ] test if image indeed runs as non-root user on plain Docker
- [ ] test if image indeed runs as non-root from docker-compose
- [ ] deployment and other configs for openshift
